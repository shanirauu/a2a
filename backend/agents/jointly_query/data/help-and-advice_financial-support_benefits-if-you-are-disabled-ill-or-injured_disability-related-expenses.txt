# Disability-Related Expenses (DRE)

## Overview
Disability-related expenses refer to additional costs incurred when caring for someone with a disability or medical condition. These expenses can vary widely and may include special dietary needs, medications not covered by the NHS, and other necessary services or equipment.

## Financial Assessment
When a local authority or trust assesses an individual's care needs, they also conduct a financial assessment to determine potential contributions towards care costs. 

### Key Points:
- **Flat Rate Contribution**: Local authorities may allocate a flat rate (typically Â£15-20 per week) to cover disability-related expenses.
- **Honesty in Disclosure**: It's essential to be open about all expenses during the assessment to ensure accurate consideration.
- **Support During Assessment**: Individuals can request a friend, family member, or advocate to assist during the financial assessment.

### Tips for Evidence Submission

- Use a chart to detail each expense, including item, cost, reason, and evidence.
- If receipts are unavailable, document any extenuating circumstances.

## Challenging Decisions
If a local authority does not accept certain disability-related expenses:
- Request a copy of the financial assessment and reasons for denial.
- Obtain a supporting letter from a healthcare provider.
- Challenge the decision calmly and provide additional evidence if possible.
- Familiarize yourself with the complaints procedure for further escalation.

## Additional Support
