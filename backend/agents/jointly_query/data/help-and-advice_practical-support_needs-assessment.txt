# Needs Assessment

## What is a Needs Assessment?
- A needs assessment is a free evaluation provided by your local council or trust to determine what help someone may need with their care.
- It is not a test; rather, it is an opportunity to discuss support options with a trained professional.
- The assessment focuses on the individual's difficulties in self-care and how these affect their daily life.

## Who Can Have a Needs Assessment?
- Anyone aged 18 and above who appears to need care and support can request a needs assessment, regardless of their financial situation.
- Carers can also request a needs assessment for themselves.

## How to Request a Needs Assessment
1. **For Yourself or Someone Else**: 
   - Contact the local council or trust and inform them of the need for a care assessment.
   - If urgent support is needed, services may be provided before a full assessment is completed.

2. **Assessment Process**:
   - A trained care professional will discuss the individual's ability to manage daily tasks (e.g., washing, dressing, cooking).
   - The person being assessed must be involved, and their needs and wishes should be taken into account.

## Eligibility Criteria
The individual will be eligible for support if they:
1. Need support due to a physical or mental illness or disability.
2. Are unable to achieve two or more care outcomes (e.g., personal hygiene, managing household tasks).
3. Experience significant impact on their wellbeing.

## Types of Support Available
- Services may include:
  - Disability equipment or home adaptations
  - Assistance from care workers
  - Residential care
  - Access to day centers

## Financial Assessment
- The local council or trust will conduct a financial assessment to determine if the individual needs to contribute to their care costs.

## If You Are Not Satisfied with the Outcome
- If there are issues with the local council, trust, or care service, you can seek to resolve these concerns through appropriate channels.

## Additional Assessments
- **Young Carers**: Those under 18 who care for a relative can receive a different assessment focusing on their needs and future opportunities.
- **Parent Carers**: Parents of disabled children are entitled to a parent carer’s needs assessment.
- **Carer’s Assessment**: For adult carers (18+), this assessment focuses on the support needed to ease the caring role.

## Conclusion
A needs assessment is a crucial step in accessing necessary support and resources for both individuals requiring care and their carers. It is important to understand the process and the available options to ensure the best outcomes for all involved.
